## BackBook Blog

I developed a full-featured blog application built with Next.js and React that delivers a seamless content management experience. This project demonstrates modern web development practices while providing intuitive user interactions.
The platform features a robust post management system where users can create, edit, and delete blog posts with rich content including text and images. Each post displays with an elegant card interface that includes expandable content sections for improved readability.
The application leverages Next.js page routing to create a multi-page experience with dedicated Home, About, and Contact sections. The responsive design ensures optimal viewing across all devices from mobile to desktop.

## Features

- Create new blog posts with title, content, date, and image upload
- Edit existing blog posts
- Delete blog posts with confirmation modal
- Expandable post content for better readability
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Multi-page routing with Next.js (Home, About, Contact)
- Contact form that sends inquiries directly to my email

## Project Structure

The application consists of several key components:

- BlogForm: Main parent component that manages the state of blog posts and handles CRUD operations
- NewPost: Form component for creating and editing blog posts
- BlogCard: Component for displaying individual blog posts with expand, edit, and delete functionality
- Modal: Confirmation dialog for delete operations
- About Header: Component for displaying the header of the about page.
- About Body: Component for the body of the About page with a call to action to contact us.
- Accordion: This component contains the data for the accordion component. It maps over the data and renders the SingleAccordion component for each item in the data array.
- Single Accordion: This component contains the title and content of the accordion.
- Photo Icon: This component contains the photo that is rendered in the About and Contact pages
- Contact Header: Component for displaying the header of the contact page
- Contact Body: Component for displaying the body of the contact page. This contains the form that uses EmailJS to send all data from the form to my personal email.
- Nav Bar: Component that displays the nav bar on the Contact and About pages.
- Footer: Simple footer component displaying copyright information

## Project Walkthrough

## Page Routing

This application uses Next.js routing to navigate between pages:

- Home (/) - Main blog post listing and management
- About (/about) - Information about the blog-author
- Contact (/contact) - Contact formm for user inquiries
- not-found.jsx - File in React to handle 404 errors when a user tries to access a route that does not exist.

## BlogForm Component

This is the main parent component that:

- Manages the state of all blog posts
- Controls the visibility of the post creation form
- Handles post creation, editing, and deletion
- Passes data and callback functions to child components

## NewPost Component

This component renders a form that:

- Captures user input for blog posts (username, title, date, content, image)
- Handles both creation of new posts and editing of existing posts
- Uses controlled form inputs with React state
- Supports image file uploads

## BlogCard Component

This component displays a single blog post with:

- Post title, author, date, and content
- An expandable content section
- Edit and delete buttons
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes

## Modal Component

A reusable confirmation dialog that:

- Appears when a user attempts to delete a post
- Provides cancel and confirm options
- Uses backdrop blur for a modern UI effect

## Contact Form Component

This component provides a user inquiry form that:

- Collects user name, email, and message
- Validates form inputs
- Uses EmailJS to send the inquiry directly to your personal email
- Provides feedback on successful submission

## About Body Component

This component contains the main content of the About page:

- Presents information about the blog, its purpose, and the author
- Features a call-to-action directing visitors to the Contact page

## Accordion Component

This component acts as a container for expandable content sections:

- Maps through a data array to dynamically generate accordion items
- Manages the state of which accordion sections are expanded/collapsed
- Provides a structured way to present information in a space-efficient manner
- Implements smooth animations for expanding and collapsing content
- Renders the SingleAccordion component for each item in the data array

## Single Accordion Component

This component renders an individual expandable section within the Accordion:

- Displays a clickable title bar that toggles content visibility
- Contains hidden content that appears when expanded
- Includes visual indicators (icons/arrows) showing expanded/collapsed state
- Manages its own open/close state with smooth transitions

## Photo Icon Component

This reusable component displays imagery across multiple pages:

- Renders optimized images for the About and Contact pages
- Supports various image formats with appropriate fallbacks
- Implements responsive sizing based on viewport dimensions

## Contact Header Component

This component introduces the Contact page:

- Features a clear, inviting header that encourages communication
- Sets expectations for the contact form below

# Contact Body Component

This component contains the primary functionality of the Contact page:

- Houses the contact form with fields for name, email, and message
- Implements form validation to ensure proper data entry
- Integrates with EmailJS to process and forward form submissions
- Provides user feedback on submission status (success/error)
- Includes privacy information regarding how contact information will be used
- Features responsive design for optimal viewing on all devices

## Nav Bar Component

This navigation component appears on the About and Contact pages:

- Provides intuitive navigation between different sections of the application
- Features links to Home, About, and Contact pages
- Highlights the current active page for user orientation
- Implements responsive design, possibly collapsing to a hamburger menu on smaller screens
- Maintains consistent styling with the overall application theme
- Enhances user experience by providing clear pathways between different sections
- RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.

## How It Works

Creating a Post:

- Click the "Create New Post" button
- Fill out the form with your username, title, date, content, and optional image
- Click "Add Post" to save your post

Editing a Post:

- Click the "Edit" button on any post
- The form will be pre-filled with the post's current content
- Make your changes and click "Update Post"

Deleting a Post:

- Click the "Delete" button on any post
- Confirm deletion in the modal dialog

Expanding Content:

- Click "Expand" to see the full content of a post
- Click "Read Less" to collapse it again

Data Persistence
Currently, the application stores data in-memory using React state. When the page refreshes, it will revert to the default post. To add persistence, you could:

- Implement local storage
- Connect to a backend API
- Add a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL

Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for the project:

- User authentication
- Comments section
- Post categories and tags
- Search functionality
- Data persistence with a database
- Social media sharing
